            <p>Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 hurricane, landed in Puerto Rico on Wednesday,
                Sept. 20, destroying the infrastructure and energy distribution systems on the island. </p>
            <p>Yelling chants like ‚Äúrelease the relief‚Äù and ‚Äúcancel the debt,‚Äù
               participants held banners with messages like ‚Äú3.5 million U.S. citizens no water no food,‚Äù
               eluding to the death of people on the island because of these lacking resources and calling
               for essential supplements from the U.S. government for equal treatment for the island as for Miami
               and Texas.</p>

          <p> Chicago Boricua Resistance, a coalition in support of Puerto Rican independence,
              organized the rally. Rossana Rodriguez, one of the organization‚Äôs founders, said it was
              formed one and a half years ago to fight the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic
              Stability Act, a law created to establish a fiscal control board in Puerto Rico to enforce a $74
              billion debt on Puerto Ricans.</p>
          <p> Rodriguez said the Puerto Rican government went bankrupt and people need monetary help to
              rebuild their homes. She said there‚Äôs no way to pay the debt.</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p> It‚Äôs illegal, it‚Äôs immoral and it‚Äôs inhumane,‚Äù Rodriguez said. ‚ÄúWe have no business paying
              that money; we didn‚Äôt even use it.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> Sixto Lopez, one of the speakers, said the island needs a plan to deliver the supplies stuck on
              the ports to people in need. U.S. military with its powerful technology should be responsible for
              the delivery, he said. </p>
          <P> Veronica Tirado, one participant at the rally,
              said her grandmother has diabetes and needs electricity to store her insulin,
              but all the villages in Puerto Rico are in blackout. She said people such as HIV patients on
              the island need medical assistant as well.</p>
